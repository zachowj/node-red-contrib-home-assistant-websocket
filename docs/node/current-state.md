# Current State

This node is used to fetch the last known state of any entity within Home Assistant when it receives an input. Itâ€™s useful for making decisions based on the current status of entities, such as checking if a light is already on before turning it off, or determining the temperature reading before adjusting the thermostat.

## Configuration

### Entity ID <Badge text="required"/>

- Type: `string`
- Accepts [Mustache Templates](/guide/mustache-templates.md)

The id of the entity to return.

### If State

- Type: `string`

If the conditional statement is evaluated as true send the message to the first
output otherwise send it to the second output. If blank there will only be one
output.

**Also see:**

- [Conditionals](/guide/conditionals.md)

### For

- Type: `number`

The amount of time the entity state needs to have been constant for the "If state" to be `true`

### State Type

::: warning DEPRECATED
This feature is being phased out and will be removed in version **1.0.0**.  
Use the **output properties** for state conversion moving forward.
:::

- Type: `string`
- Values: `string|number|boolean`
- Default: `string`

Convert the state of the entity to the selected type. Boolean will be converted to true based on if the string is equal by default to (`y|yes|true|on|home|open`). Original value stored in `msg.data.original_state`

### Block Input Overrides

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

Stop `msg.payload` values from overriding local config

## Inputs

### payload.entityId

- Type : `string`

  Overrides or sets the entity id for which the current state is being fetched

## Outputs

- `entity`: full entity object
- `entity id`: entity id of the triggered entity
