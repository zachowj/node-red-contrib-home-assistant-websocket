# Poll State

The Poll State node outputs the state of an entity at regular intervals. It can also be configured to trigger at startup and whenever the entity changes state, if desired. This node is useful for regularly checking the status of an entity, ensuring your automations stay up to date with the latest information.

## Configuration

### Entity ID <Badge text="required"/>

The entity id of the entity to poll for.

### Update Interval

- Type: `number`

The amount of time between checking/sending updates.

### If State

- Type: `string`

If the conditional statement is evaluated as true send the message to the first output otherwise send it to the second output. If blank there will only be one output.
